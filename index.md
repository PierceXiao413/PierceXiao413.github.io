I am a second-year graduate student in [State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture](http://www.carch.ac.cn/), [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SKL, ICT, CAS)](http://www.ict.cas.cn/). I am supervised by Prof. [Yunquan Zhang](http://sourcedb.ict.cas.cn/cn/jssrck/201308/t20130822_3917018.html) on the high performance computing including performance tuning, SIMD optimization, GPGPU.

# Education
- 2017.9-now, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Master., High Performance Computing, Supervisor: Prof. [Yunquan Zhang](http://sourcedb.ict.cas.cn/cn/jssrck/201308/t20130822_3917018.html).

- 2013.9-2017.7, Yunnan University, B.Eng, Computer Science. 

# Research Projects

- RealFFT Library, High performance implementation of Real FFT on both ARMv8 and X86-64 CPU.

   - Implement stockham butterfly-network for even-size real input data, including 11 real FFT kinds.
   
   - Optimize split operations in NEON and AVX on ARMv8 and X86 respectively.

   - Faster than [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) on ARMv8 platform, and achieve a nearly matchable performance than [MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl/features/fft) for some kinds.

- A high-performance gaussian filter on GPU based on OpenCL.

- A high-performance IPP library on ARMv8 architecture.

   - Implement performance primitives on ARMv8 corresponding to Intel IPP counterpart, such as median filter, max, min, e^x, ln(x).

   - Optimize these operations with NEON intrinsics on ARMv8.

# Internship

- Amazon AWS AI Lab

- Develop numpy-compatible operator for MXNet.
